        <h1>Thomas J. Watson</h1>
        <p>Mr. Watson was born in Campbell, N.Y., February 17, 1874. His first job was at age 18 as a bookkeeper in Clarence Risley's Market in Painted Post, N.Y. Later he sold sewing machines and musical instruments before joining the National Cash Register Company as a salesman in Buffalo. He eventually worked his way up to general sales manager. Bent on inspiring the dispirited NCR sales force, Mr. Watson introduced the motto, "THINK," which later became a widely known symbol of IBM<br>
        <p>Watson was active in civic affairs and was noted for his efforts on behalf of the arts and world peace. In his honour, his wife started the Thomas J. Watson Foundation in 1961. In 1968 their four children focused the foundation money toward education and world affairs, issues that were of primary importance to their father throughout his life, and launched the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship, which offered college graduates a one-year grant for independent study and travel outside the United States.</p>
